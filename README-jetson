Steps for Integrating Respeaker Circular 4-Mic Array with Jetson Platforms

1.  Download relevant kernel sources for modification

2.  Patch the kernel source as per instructions below

    a. Refer the patch provided as part of the repo for patching kernel

        Patch for L4T 32.3.1 (part of JetPack 4.3) - jetson_BSP32.3.patch
        NOTE: Make sure to patch platform relevant DTs.

    b. Copy following files from jetson-respeaker-4mic-array-compatible branch
       of seeed-voicecard repo to kernel source directory path:
       "Linux_for_Tegra/source/public/kernel/kernel-4.9/sound/soc/codecs/"

        ac108.h
        ac108.c
        ac101.c
        ac101_regs.h
        ac10x.h
        sound-compatible-4.18.h

2. Compile kernel and this would generate updated kernel and kernel-dtb images

3. Flash updated kernel and kernel-dtb partitions and reboot

4. Necessary pinmux configuration has to be done after reboot 

	sudo /opt/nvidia/jetson-io/config-by-function.py -o dtb i2s1
	sudo reboot
	
	NOTE: I2S Instance and clk on 40-pin header used depends on the Jetson platform being used.
	
5. Below script can be used to record 4 channel audio data

	amixer -c 1 cset name="ADMAIF9 Mux" "I2S1"
	amixer -c 1 cset name="I2S1 codec frame mode" "dsp-a"
	amixer -c 1 cset name="I2S1 codec master mode" "cbm-cfm"
	amixer -c 1 cset name="I2S1 fsync width" 0
	arecord -D hw:1,8 -r 16000 -c 4 -f S32_LE -t wav -d 10 ./out.wav &

	NOTE: I2S Instance used depends on the Jetson platform being used.
